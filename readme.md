#Welcome to REACT!
REACT is an easy to use property management software build with Meteor (node, react, mongodb).

React will keep track of your rental income, expenses and maintenance, while generating accounting statements for you.

Accounting statements can be generated with the dates of your choosing in the browser and saved to PDF for your personal records.

Managers are given a seperate app from the owners which allows them to manage maintenance and billpaying without having access to your personal accounting.

The apps have build in real time chat as well as data visualization of impactful results.
